# gw_smpa_r\_assignment_chartsmaps

This assignment covers making basic charts and maps using ggplot2 and tmap packages.

To download and load this as a project inside of RStudio, run this line in the console:

`usethis::use_course("https://github.com/amkessler/gw_smpa_r_assignment_chartsmaps/archive/refs/heads/main.zip")`

It will prompt you with choices as to whether you want to download the project, as well as if you want to keep the zipped file. You can say yes to both.

Once the project has been created on your laptop, you should see all the associated files needed to complete the assignment.

The assignment file itself is a Quarto document in this repo (`assignment_chartsmaps_yourname.qmd)`. Rename the assignment file you're using to replace your own name instead of "yourname."

Similarly, in the "author" section at the top of the Quarto document, place your own name there instead of the placeholder text.

The data we'll use for this assignment involves election results in Georgia. The `ga_votes.xlsx` file is included in this repo.

When you are finished, please upload your completed Quarto (qmd) file to Blackboard. You need not upload any other files, just the finished qmd file. But just make sure it has been renamed to include your own name in the file name.
